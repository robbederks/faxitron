GPIF to USB Transfer Example
----------------------------

  This example illustrates the use of a DMA channel to continuously
  transfer data from the GPIF port to the USB host.

  A stub GPIF state machine which does not require any external devices
  is used to continuously commit data into the DMA buffers. This state
  machine continues to push data into the DMA channel whenever the thread
  is in the ready state.

  The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with one Bulk-IN
  endpoint. The data committed by the GPIF state machine is continuously
  streamed to this endpoint without any firmware intervention.

  The application also implements a pair of BULK-OUT and BULK-IN endpoints
  configured in a data loop back configuration. This data loop-back is done
  with firmware intervention using a pair of MANUAL-IN and MANUAL-OUT DMA
  channels. This can be changed to a hardware based AUTO loopback using the
  LOOPBACK_AUTO pre-processor definition.

  This application also demonstrates the use of the endpoint specific
  CYU3P_USBEP_SS_RESET_EVT event to detect and recover from potential USB
  data corruption due to protocol level errors.

  PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

  As the GPIF state machine used here continues to commit data to the DMA channel
  whenever possible, the transfer performance depends on the capabilities of the
  USB host and on transfer parameters such as endpoint burst length; and the amount
  of data buffering available.

  The following constants defined in the cyfxgpiftousb.h header file are used to
  vary these parameters and study their impact on transfer rate. It is also possible
  to vary these parameters on the compiler command line by adding them to the list
  of pre-processor definitions.

  1. CY_FX_EP_BURST_LENGTH  : Burst length for the endpoint in terms of 1 KB packets.
                              This is set to 8 KB by default.
  2. CY_FX_DMA_BUF_SIZE     : Size of each DMA buffer used on the DMA channel.
                              This is set to 16 KB by default.
  3. CY_FX_DMA_BUF_COUNT    : Number of DMA buffers used for the DMA channel.
                              This is set to 4 buffers by default.
