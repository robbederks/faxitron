    \brief The Processor Interface Block (PIB) on the FX3 device contains the
    GPIF-II controller and the associated DMA sockets and configuration registers.
    The PIB driver in FX3 firmware is responsible for managing PIB bound data
    transfers and interrupts. This file contains the data types and API definitions
    for the general P-port functionality that is independent of the electrical
    protocol implemented by GPIF-II.

    The default values used by the driver are:\n

/** \brief Enumeration of P-port error types.

    **Description**\n
    The P-port interface block (PIB) of the FX3 device can encounter various errors during
    data transfers performed across the GPIF interface. This enumerated type lists the PIB level
    error conditions that are notified to the user application through the CYU3P_PIB_INTR_ERROR
    interrupt callback. The cbArg parameter passed to the callback will indicate the PIB error code
    as well as the GPIF error code.
 
    The CYU3P_GET_PIB_ERROR_TYPE macro can be used to decode the PIB error type from the callback
    argument.

/** \brief Select the MMC Slave mode of operation for the P-port interface block.

    **Description**\n
    The P-port interface block (PIB) on the FX3/FX3S devices can be configured to
    function in the GPIF-II mode or in the MMC Slave mode. In the MMC slave mode,
    the device appears as a MMC 4.2 spec compliant slave device which accepts
    commands from a MMC host controller.

    This function is used to switch the PIB block to the MMC Slave mode (from the
    default GPIF-II mode). As this is a static mode selection, this function is
    expected to be called before the PIB block is initialized.

    **Return Value**\n
    * CY_U3P_SUCCESS if the switch request is registered.
    * CY_U3P_ERROR_ALREADY_STARTED if the PIB block is already active.
