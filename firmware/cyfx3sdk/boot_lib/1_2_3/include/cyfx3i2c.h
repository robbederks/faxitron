/** \brief Structure defining the preamble to be sent on the I2C interface.

    **Description**\n
    All I2C data transfers start with a preamble where the first byte contains
    the slave address and the direction of transfer. The preamble can optionally
    contain other bytes where device specific address values or other commands
    are sent to the slave device.

    The FX3 device supports associating a preamble with a maximum length of
    8 bytes to any I2C data transfer. This allows the user to specify a multi-byte
    preamble which covers the slave address, device specific address fields and then
    initiate the data transfer.

    The ctrlMask indicate the start / stop bit conditions after each byte of
    the preamble.

    For example, an I2C EEPROM read requires the byte address for the read to
    be written first. These two I2C operations can be combined into one I2C API
    call using the parameters of the structure.

    Typical I2C EEPROM page Read operation:

    Byte 0:\n
         Bit 7 - 1: Slave address.\n
         Bit 0    : 0 - Indicating this is a write from master.\n
    Byte 1, 2: Address to which the data has to be written.\n
    Byte 3:\n
         Bit 7 - 1: Slave address.\n
         Bit 0    : 1 - Indicating this is a read operation.\n
    The buffer field shall hold the above four bytes, the length field shall be
    four; and ctrlMask field will be 0x0004 as a start bit is required after the
    third byte (third bit is set).

    Typical I2C EEPROM page Write operation:

    Byte 0:\n
         Bit 7 - 1: Slave address.\n
         Bit 0    : 0 - Indicating this is a write from master.\n
    Byte 1, 2: Address to which the data has to be written.\n
    The buffer field shall hold the above three bytes, the length field shall be
    three, and the ctrlMask field is zero as no additional start/stop conditions are
    needed.
