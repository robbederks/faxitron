    \brief The Boot APIs for FX3 provide a low footprint API library that can be used
    to put together simple FX3 applications, primarily for the purpose of building
    custom boot-loaders.

    **Description**\n
    The regular FX3 API library is designed for maximum flexibility and performance, and
    makes use of an embedded OS. This results in a higher memory footprint for simple
    applications. This is not always desirable, particularly in cases where a small
    boot-loader type application is required to improve the flexibility and robustness
    of the boot process.

    The FX3 boot API library is provided to address this problem, and provides a low
    footprint set of APIs without any RTOS dependency. This library only supports a
    small set of features, all of which are targeted at building booting applications.

    The software boot supports the following interfaces on the FX3 device:\n
    1. USB device mode\n
    2. SPI\n
    3. I2C\n
    4. UART\n
    5. GPIO\n

    This library does not make use of an RTOS and minimal use of interrupts. All of the
    serial peripheral APIs operate on a polling model, and it is expected that these
    will be called in the appropriate sequence from the firmware main.

    The only interrupt that is enabled is for the USB block. This interrupt handler
    ensures that all of the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 link and protocol requests are handled
    appropriately, and provides hooks in the form of callback functions.

    \section Fx3Memories FX3 Memory Regions
    \brief ITCM and SYSMEM memory address ranges on the FX3 device.

    **Description**\n
    The I-TCM is a 16 KB memory region which is tightly coupled to the ARM9 CPU
    and can be used to locate interrupt service routines. The first 256 bytes of
    the I-TCM are reserved for setting up the ARM exception vectors.

    The SYSMEM region is the main code/data RAM on the FX3 device, and can be
    512 KB or 256 KB in size depending on the part being used. The first 8 KB of
    the SYSMEM is reserved for holding DMA related data structures (descriptors).
